Hello! ^_^
We are 3 ladies from She Goes Tech Java II Bootcamp course – Jelizaveta Simanoviča, Līvija Paegle and Aleksandra Gorbule. 

It is our Final project Web Application "RestartYourLove”. 
TheMAIN IDEA is about understanding, improving relationships and feeling better each other. 

Our project will solve at least 2 most popular questions: 
1.	What to do in the evening?
2.	What to do TOGETHER?
The content inside the App is like calendar for one month with 30 tasks/challenges). For example: 
#1Day - Try yoga exercises for couples
#2Day - Karaoke evening with your favorite songs 
#3Day - Cook Pizza together etc.
There is only one rule ---> ALL the task should be done TOGETHER WITH your PARNER! <3 

Short instructions for User	
1.	Open the link. You will see the HOME page with the same instructions. 
2.	Press button to LOG IN  if you already have an account or SIGN UP to create a new account. Don’t be afraid, we will not ask you about your personal information. Only username and password are needed. 
3.	After login process you will see task list page with all the tasks. Choose any number from the “Task Calendar” and click on it. Probably, the idea was to finish them one by one, but you can change the order if you want. 
4.	Now you will see the tasks description and the status button "DONE". Press the button when the task will be finished. P.S. You can also UNDONE the task (if clicked on by mistake). 
5.	Probably it is the end. We promise this will be unforgettable adventure for your couple! Good luck and Enjoy this time TOGETHER!
