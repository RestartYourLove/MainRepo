Hello! ^_^

Here is our Final project Idea - application "Restart Your Love". Sounds like something 18+ :D, but the idea is about understanding, improving relationships and feeling better each other . 

The content will be like calendar for one month with 30/31 tasks (what to do together in the evening for couples). For example: 

#1Day - Try yoga exercises for couples

#2Day - Karaoke evening with your favorite songs 

#3Day - Cook Pizza together 

#4Day - Meditation

#5Day - Create a wish card 

etc.

Here you can find more exampes from us: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVObMP1gs=/

Of course, there will be opportunity to mark task when it is done (or failed). 

Also can be added an opportunity to add new task.

Opening the task will be seen additional information - materials (photo, instructions, links with video, song etc.) to clarify  todays task and provide some examples. 
There will be opportunity to login, save and see the progress. That is way Data Base is needed. 

Good news that the project can be realized as Mobile App or as Web. But I prefer Web Solution for this.

P.S. For me it sounds very challenging and interesting! A lot of work but the result will be useful for everyone smile 

Thank your for attention! And good luck for us!
